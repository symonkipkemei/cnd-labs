# Use a quotes API, e.g. http://quotes.stormconsultancy.co.uk/random.json
# to fetch a random quote. Then use string manipulation to convert it to
# Doge speech (https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/sciencecommunication/2016/10/22/how-to-speak-doge/)
# Create a tiny webpage that displays a doge image together
# with the altered quote. You can get an image URL from another API:
# http://shibe.online/api/shibes
# Write the code logic to make the API calls and assign the output to
# `doged_quote` and `doge_image_url` respectively.
# Then write the `html` string to a `.html` file and look at it in your browser.
