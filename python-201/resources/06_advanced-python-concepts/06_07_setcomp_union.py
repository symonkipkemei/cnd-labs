# Use the union operator `|` to intersect the two given sets
# inside of a set comprehension that squares each item of the
# set if the number is higher than `2`.
# You should write the whole code logic in only one line.
#
# Expected output: {16, 9, 25, 49}
#
# Remember that sets are unordered collections, so your numbers
# might come out in a different order.
