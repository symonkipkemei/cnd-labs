Michael Hanna is an Irish judge who has been a Judge of the High Court since 2004.


Early life[edit]
Hanna originates from Belfast and was educated at St MacNissi's College. His father was Frank Hanna, a Northern Ireland Labour Party MP.[1] He was educated at Trinity College Dublin and the King's Inns.[2] He is a former auditor of the College Historical Society.[3]
He became a barrister in 1976 and a senior counsel in 1996.[2] Hanna's practice was focused on the Dublin and South-Eastern circuits, where he specialised in personal injury cases and the law of tort.[2] Criminal cases also formed part of his practice.[4]

Judicial career[edit]
Hanna was appointed to the High Court in 2004.[5] He was appointed following recommendation by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.[6] He presided over a planning law case involving Van Morrison and his wife Michelle Rocca in 2010.[7] He was the judge in a 2011 case taken by Ryanair against a German ticket sale website, in which he held that ticket scraping was a breach of Ryanair's website terms. This was considered to be the first Irish case involving the enforceability of online terms of service.[8] He often acted as judge at the Court of Criminal Appeal, prior to its disbandment following the establishment of the Court of Appeal.[9]
He frequently hears personal injuries cases in the High Court. He applied a test of "ordinary common sense" to assess evidence in a personal injuries case involving a woman who had slipped in a car park.[10] This test was endorsed in a judgment of Mary Irvine in the Court of Appeal.[11]

Personal life[edit]
He became ill while in Spain in 2014 and was in an induced coma. He was unable to hear cases for a period of time following.[9] Hanna is a singer of opera.[12]
