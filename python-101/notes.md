  - Increase your value


<h1 id = "build">4. Build something</h1>

  - Guess My number
  - play the game
  - programming concepts

<h1 id = "set">5. Set up your machine</h1>

   - hardware specifications
   - Operating system (Course built on unix sysytem)
       - [Setting up WSL](https://forum.codingnomads.co/t/developing-on-windows-with-wsl-2/791)

   - Software programs ( Vscode)
   - Installation test
      -  ``` 
         python3 --version 
         ```
   - A little bit of fun
      - Enter interactive mode of the python interpreter
        ```
        python3
        import this
        exit()
        ```

   - The python intepreter
     - Run and evaluate code line by line
     - its also known as (REPLs) Read-evaluate-print-loop
     - Once intepreter is closed code is gone.
     - IDE (Integrated development environment) solves this

   - VS code
      - Write, navigate & execute

   - The python console
      - a.K.a python console, python shell, python intepreter
   - Python scripts
      - procedural programming ( from top to bottom)
      - create python script ( add extension.py)
      - Run the script with command, terminal must point to the folder where the script is saved
       ```
       python3 <name of the script.py>
       ```
      - Run the script with button
   - Create your folder structure
   - Get your lab exercises



<h1 id = "intro">6. Introduction to programming</h1>

- A match made in heaven
    - computers are Precise, fast and don't mind repetition ( my take; all things that are repetitive in nature can be automized)
    - Humans are good in ideas and conceptualizing solutuions
    - A much made in heaven, we need a common language.
- Scripts and scripting
- Automate something.
- Pseudocode
  - organized thoughts
  - in between your idea and a functional code
- Code comments and dicriptiveness
```
# at the beginning of the line to make it a code comment
```
- Why code comments
  - exclusively for human beings
  - Undesrtand
  - Maintain
  - Improve
  - Extend
  - Debug
- How to write code comments (improve on this)
  - Rationale: Comments Tell You Why code was written in the way it was, rather than how the code does something or what it does.
  - Human-Focus: Code comments, as well as code style, are for humans only. But that doesn't make them less important!
  - Descriptiveness: What the code does, and how it accomplishes it, should be self-explanatory through well-written code and descriptively named variables

   - [DigitalOcean:  How to Write Comments in Python 3](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-write-comments-in-python-3)

- Pass Keyword
  - Placeholder when building code
  - Unlike code comments, python reads it and unadertsnads that it shouldn't do anything
- The print Function
  - display
  - print out
  - inspect/debug
- Scripts vs console
  


<h1 id = "var">7. Variables and types</h1>

- python variables
  - name of a value
  - reference that points to a value
- Variable assignment
   - ``` assignment operator = ```
- variables rules and conventions
  - Start With a Character and not a numbet
  - Don't Use Spaces
  - Avoid Reserved Keywords

- Coventions ( Best practice)
  - Use Lower-Case
  - Use Descriptive Names
  - Use Snake Case
- Multiple variable assignment
- Reserved Keywords
  ```
  python3
  help("keywords")
  ```
- Learn about individual keywords
  ```
  python3
  help("False")
  ```

- Variables updates
  -  Dynamic typing
  -  Duck typing
- Data types
- Type checking
   - check the type of data ina variable
   ```
   type(num)
   ```
- Type operations
  - Integers
  - strings
  - float
  - booleans
  - lists
  - dictionaries

- [Built-in types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#built-in-types)

- Nothingness
 - Their is adifference between 0 and Nothing
 - ```
   Nothing = None
   ```
